		<h1>What is computer?</h1>
	<p><strong>A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions<br> stored in its own memory, that can accept data<u><i>(input)</i></u>, process the data according to specified<br> rules<u>(process)</u>, produce results<u><i>(output)</i></u>, and store the result<u><i>(storage)</i></u> for futher use. Generally<br> the term is used to described a collection of hardware components that make up a personal computer.</strong><br> Computers are everywhere: at work, at school, and at home. In the workplace, employees use computer<br> to create correspondence such as <u><b>e-mail</U></b>, <u><b>memos</u></b>, and <u><b>letter</u></b>; <u><b>calculate payroll</u></b>; <u><b>track inventory</u></b>;<br> and <u><b>generate invoices</u></b>. At school, teachers use computers to assist with classroom instruction. Students<br> complete assignment and do research on computers. At home, people spend hours of leisure<br> time on the computer. They play games communicate with friends and relatives using e-mail, purchase<br> goods online, chat in chat rooms, listen to music, watch movies and videos, read books and magazines,<br> research genealogy, compose music and videos, retouch photographs, and plan vacations. At work,<br> at school, and at home, computers are helping people do their work faster, more accurately, and in<br> some cases, in ways that previously would not have been possible.</p>

		<h3>Why is a Computer so powerful?</h3>
	
	<p><b>A computer derives its power from its capability to perform the information processing<br>cysle with amazing speed, reliability(low failure rate), and accuracy, its capaacity to store <br> huge amounts of data and information; and its ability to communicate with other computers.</b><br> For a  computer to perform operations, it must be given a detailed set of instructions that tells it<br> exactly what to do. These instructions are called computer program, or software. Before processing<br> for a specific job begins, the computer corresponding to that job is stored in the computer. <br> Once the program is stored, the computer can begin to operate by executing the program's first instruction.<br>The computer executes one program instruction after another until the job is complete.</P>

<!-- This section of the html code talks about basic things that make up a computer
-->
			<h4>What are the components of a computer?</h4>

	<P>To understand how computers process data into information, you need to examine<br>the primary components of the computer.<u><strong> The six primary components of the computer.</u></strong> The six<br> primary components of a computer are input devices, the processor(control unit and arithmetic/logic unit),<br> memory, output devices, storage devices, and communication devices. The<big> processor</big>,<big> memory</big>, and<br> <big>storage devices</big> are housed in a box like case called the <u><i><b>system unit</u></i></b>.</p>

	<h5>Networks And Internet</h5>

		<p><i>A netwok is a collection of computer and devices connected together, often wireless<br> via</i> <b><i><u><big>communication devices</b></i></u></big> and <b><i><u><big>transmission media</b></i></u></big>. When a computer connects to a network, it is online.<br> These networks can be relatively small or quite extensive. A network that connects computers in a <br>limited geographical area, such as a school computer laboratory, office or grouping of<br> building, is called a local area network<abbr>(LAN)</abbr>.<i> A network that covers a large geographical area, such<br> as one that connects the district offices of a national coperation, is called a wide area network</i><abbr>(WAN)</abbr></p>
		
		<h6>The Internet</h6>

<p><b>The world's largest network is the Internet,</b> which is a <i>worldwide</i> collection of networks<br>that connects millions of business, government agencies, educational institution, and individuals.<br>With an abundance of resources and the data accessible via the internet, more than one billion people<br>around the world use the internet for a viariety of reasons. Most users connect to<br> the internet through a regional or national ISP, an online service provider, or a wireless internet<br> service provider. An <abbr>ISP</abbr><strong>(Internet Service Provider)</strong> is an organization, such as a cable company<br> or telephone company that supplies connections to the internet for a monthly fee.
